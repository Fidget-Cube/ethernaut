Congratulations! This practice of calling a function on a calling contract before sending resources is quite a common practice. When a contract is published to the blockchain it is immutable, so if resources like tokens are sent to a contract that has no way of dealing with those tokens, those tokens are lost forever. Because of this, contract standards have adopted checks that make sure a recieving contract is built to handle the resources it is receiving.
